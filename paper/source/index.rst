The Security Requirements
=========================

The following is reproduced from documentation generated entirely from the `01_gateways.sdoc` hosted in https://github.com/nmfta-repo/vcr-experiment at commit d81be02e951e3ab05e65c5c965d13b05bb29c8a6. The `01_gateways.sdoc` file is also the source of a machine-readable Requirements Interchange (ReqIF) file hosted too in https://github.com/nmfta-repo/vcr-experiment. It is the strictdoc tool (https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc) that is used to generate both the following human-readable documentation and the ReqIF machine-readable format.
